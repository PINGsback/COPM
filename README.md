# COPM
A really bad password manager for chrome

**But Why?**
You're not getting this part again.


Sad.

**INSTALLATION:**

First, clone the repo with the following: 
`git clone https://github.com/PINGsback/COPM.git`

Second, navigate to the root directory:
`cd COPM`

Next, install the requirements:
`sudo pip install -r requirements.txt`
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Now, go to the source directory:
`cd COPM`
Yes, this is a different directory

Then, run the initial setup:
`sudo python main.py`
This will set up the required files. If it tells you that the permissions were corrupted, don't worry, it is still safe to use.

**USE:**

Because of the limitations of the clipboard in chromeos, the only secure way to view passwords is to run COPM through idle. However, you should go through the initial setup in your terminal before using COPM in idle.
